     <p>My favourite city is <del>Praga</del> Podolsk! On this page I will tell you about the sights of my native place. </p>
    <p>Podolsk is a city with a rich history. Due to its unique location  in the heart of Russia, near Moscow, no historically significant event has spared it.</p>
<p>The history of Podolsk began with a small village belonging to the patrimony of the Moscow Danilov monastery  the first mention of the settlement dates back to 1627. The place developed and flourished, and at the end of the XVIII century Catherine II signed a decree on the transformation of the village into a county town. Podolsk was a reliable defense for Moscow during the war: this fortress city became a barrier for enemies, protecting the southern approaches to the capital in 1941.</p>

<h2>Dubrovitsy Manor and Znamenskaya Church</h2>
<p>The noble estate near Podolsk (in the village of Dubrovitsy) was built in the XVII century. The first owner of the building and land in the district was boyar Morozov. In the future, the owners of the estate changed: the Golitsyns, the Dmitrievs-Mamonovs, and the Potemkins lived here. Unfortunately, most of the things were not preserved: in the XX century, both furniture and art objects were taken out. But here you can see the hall of arms, the walls of which are decorated with frescoes. On the territory there is an alley with a centuryЧold lime park - they say there are lime trees planted by Peter I.</p>

<h2>Glory Square</h2>
<p>The Square of Military Glory is dedicated to the Great Patriotic War. On the territory there is a memorial in memory of the feat of the Soviet people Ц installed in 1971 and reconstructed in 2010. The memorial includes a commemorative stele, plaques with the names of heroes and compositions for home front workers and internationalist soldiers. There is an eternal Flame in front of the stele. The complex also includes a monument to fellow countrymen who died while performing duty in Afghanistan and Chechnya.

Today, significant events of the city are taking place on the Square of Glory. On the eve of the Great Victory Day, there is an honor guard near the Eternal Flame Ч a memorial watch. This is an important mission, and it is entrusted to the best students of the city and military personnel of the Podolsk district.</p>

<h2>Monument to Podolsk cadets</h2>
<p>The monument to the Podolsk cadets is a landmark monument that recalls the feat of young cadets during the Great Patriotic War. It was these people who held back the enemies on the outskirts of Moscow until the arrival of Soviet troops. The monument was erected in 1975 and depicts three fighters: one raised his hand up, the others are holding machine guns.

In the summer of 1941, 3,500 cadets of artillery and infantry schools were urgently removed from classes and sent to the front near Maloyaroslavets. It was necessary to hold out for a few days. They had only light weapons with them Ц rifles, machine guns and rations for 3 days.

The cadets managed to repel several attacks by the Nazis, and during one of them the opponents raised red Soviet flags (they hoped that they would be mistaken for reinforcements that had come up). The fighting lasted longer than originally planned Ч about 2 weeks. When the reserve troops were already close, the fighters were surrounded, but were able to get out of it. And on the same day they received.</p>

<h2 style="color:orange">In conclusion.</h2>
 <p>I want to say that Podolsk is a very beautiful and interesting city. All the sights cannot be described on the pages of the site, so the author leaves them for independent consideration by readers.</p>
